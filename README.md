# Introduction.

Jeopardy is a functional programming language designed for writing
invertible algorithms without the syntactic restrictions of reversible programming.
In particular, Jeopardy allows the limited use of locally noninvertible operations,
provided that they are used in a way that can be statically determined to be globally invertible.

As the language design becomes less experimental, this repository will serve as the official
reference implementation in disseminations.
